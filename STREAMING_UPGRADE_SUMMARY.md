6. **`STREAMING_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md`** - ✅ **This summary document**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Changes Made**

#### **1. Streaming Event Processing**

```python
# Before (Non-streaming)
result = await Runner.run(current_agent, input_items, context=context)

# After (Streaming)
result = Runner.run_streamed(current_agent, input_items, context=context)
await process_streaming_response(result, context)
```

#### **2. Real-time Event Handling**

```python
async for event in result.stream_events():
    if event.type == "raw_response_event" and isinstance(event.data, ResponseTextDeltaEvent):
        # Stream text token-by-token
        print(event.data.delta, end="", flush=True)
    elif event.type == "run_item_stream_event":
        # Handle tool calls and results
    elif event.type == "agent_updated_stream_event":
        # Handle agent handoffs
```

#### **3. Streamlit Streaming Integration**

```python
# Progressive UI updates
async for event in result.stream_events():
    if event.data.delta:
        current_message += event.data.delta
        message_placeholder.markdown(current_message)  # Real-time update
```

## 🎮 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before (Traditional)**

```
User: "Teach me about photosynthesis"
[Wait 3-5 seconds...]
🤖 Agent: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy..."
```

### **After (Streaming)**

```
User: "Teach me about photosynthesis"
🤖 Agent: "Photosynthesis is" [appears immediately]
🤖 Agent: "the process by which" [continues streaming]
🤖 Agent: "plants convert sunlight..." [completes naturally]
🔧 Agent: Using personalized_content tool...
✅ Tool Result: Generated explanation for visual learner
🔄 Agent Handoff: Teaching Agent → Quiz Agent
```
